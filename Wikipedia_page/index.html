            Peafowl is a common name for two bird species in the genera <span class="text-blue">Pavo</span>  and <span class="text-blue">Afropavo</span> within the tribe <span class="text-blue1">Pavonini </span> of the family <span class="text-blue1">Phasianidae</span> (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to <span class="text-blue1">colloquially</span> as "peacocks".
            <div class="main-text-2a">The two Asiatic species are the blue or <span class="text-blue1">Indian peafowl</span> originally from the <span class="text-blue1">Indian subcontinent</span> , and the <span class="text-blue1">green peafowl </span>from Southeast Asia; The <span class="text-blue1">Congo peafowl</span> is not a true peafowl, native only to the <span class="text-blue1">Congo Basin</span>. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of <span class="text-blue1">covert feathers</span>, which they display as part of a <span class="text-blue1">courtship</span> ritual.</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">The functions of the elaborate <span class="text-blue1">iridescent</span> colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. <span class="text-blue1">Charles Darwin</span> suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by <span class="text-blue1">sexual selection.</span> More recently, <span class="text-blue1">Amotz Zahavi</span> proposed in his <span class="text-blue1">handicap principle</span> that these features <span class="text-blue1">acted as honest signals</span> of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">A group of peacocks is called an "ostentation" or a "muster".[1]</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a-1">Description</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[3]</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory.</div>
            <div class="main-text-2a">Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls.[4] Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]</div>
            <div class="main-text-3a">Iridescence and structural colouration</div>   
            <div class="main-text-2a-2">Further information: <span class="text-blue">Iridescence</span> and <span class="text-blue">Structural colouration</span></div>
            <div class="main-text-4a">As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments, but structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]</div>
            <div class="main-text-3a">Courtship</div>
            <div class="main-text-4a">Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly in front of the male peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.[8]</div>
            <div class="main-text-3a">Evolution</div>
            <div class="main-text-3a-1">Sexual selection</div>
            <div class="main-text-4a">Charles Darwin suggested in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex that peafowl plumage may have evolved through sexual selection:</div>
            <div class="main-text-4a-1">Many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock the most splendid of living birds.</div>
            <div class="main-text-3a-1">Aposematism and natural selection</div>
            <div class="main-text-4a">It has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have been formed by natural selection (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an aposematic display to intimidate predators and rivals.[9][10] This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi's observations that in Japan, neither reproductive success nor physical condition correlates with the train's length, symmetry or number of eyespots.[11]</div>
